This is repository for data preprocessing and analysis of the human gut single-cell data performed by me and published in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33290721/

# Abstract 
Human gut development requires the orchestrated interaction of various differentiating cell types. Here we generate an in-depth single-cell map of the developing human intestine at 6–10 weeks post-conception, a period marked by villus formation. Our analysis reveals the transcriptional profile of cycling epithelial precursor cells, which are transcriptionally distinct from LGR5-expressing cells. We use computational analyses to propose that these cells may contribute to differentiated cell subsets via the generation of LGR5-expressing stem cells and receive signals from the surrounding mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, we draw parallels between the transcriptomes of ex vivo tissues and in vitro fetal organoids, revealing the maturation of organoid cultures in a dish. Lastly, we compare scRNAseq profiles from paediatric Crohn’s disease epithelium alongside matched healthy controls to reveal disease-associated changes in epithelial composition. Contrasting these with the fetal profiles reveals re-activation of fetal transcription factors in Crohn’s disease epithelium. Our study provides a unique resource, available at www.gutcellatlas.org, and underscores the importance of unravelling fetal development in understanding disease.
